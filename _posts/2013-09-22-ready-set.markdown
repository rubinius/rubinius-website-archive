There are some big changes coming in Rubinius. A full post about this should
arrive later in the week, but for people who are tracking master HEAD on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius), here are a few
essential pieces of information.


## What's Changed?

I've just merged a work-in-progress branch into master. The master branch now
supports Ruby language version 2.1 only. It also moves Rubinius components,
such as the parser, compiler, debugger, as well as the Ruby standard library,
to gems. The changes lay the foundation for numerous planned features to
improve performance and concurrency support.

The syntax support for 2.1 is not yet complete but should be merged in a few
days.  Applications using Ruby 1.9.3 are expected to run. The standard library
gems are installed by default, so there should not be a noticable difference
in how programs using the standard library run.


## How To Build

To build Rubinius, MRI 2.0 or Rubinius master are required. Other versions may
work, but are not supported. Bundler is also required.

To clone and build, follow these steps:

1. git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius
1. cd rubinius
1. bundle
1. ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
1. rake

The main difference is that bundle is used to install build requirements.

After building, add `path/to/install/bin:/path/to/install/gems/bin` to PATH to
run Rubinius. Alternatively, use a Ruby switcher like
[chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby).


## Where Are 1.8 & 1.9?

There are two branches under Rubinius for
[1.8.7](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/tree/1.8.7) and
[1.9.3](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/tree/1.9.3). The default language
mode when building from the branches matches the branch name. These branches
are provided to ease transitions. No active development will occurr on the
branches. If you would like to volunteer to maintain one of the branches,
please let us know.


## Issues

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/issues)
if you have any trouble building or running the master branch.

More details coming soon. Happy Rubying!
